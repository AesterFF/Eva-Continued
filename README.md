### What does EVA offer?

EVA is an open source modification of the windows operating system which aims for:

  - A hassle free and highly automated post install to install gpu drivers, build both default and bare services/drivers scripts, disabling hidden powersaving, disabling security mitigations which harm performance, setting DSCP values and exclusive fullscreen for your games via a simple script & much much more
  - Less telemetry compared to the standard windows operating system
  - Reducing system latency & increasing 0.01% FPS lows
  - Generally a snappy, consistent & responsive environment which will reward your highly optimized bios & physical setup

### Important

  - EVA is not your average windows install. You need some common sense to complete setup properly, especially if you have an iGPU or want to install your own drivers. 
    This project is in it's early stages which means there is chances of error, the script may completely fail so ensure you have a back-up plan before you install EVA incase
    anything goes wrong. If you are not comfortable & confident with setting the OS up properly do NOT install EVA. This OS is not built for the most useless benchmarking metric,
	average fps. It's mostly catered for responsiveness and higher 0.01% lows, the real fps metric.

  - Post install is meant for one time setup, do not change anything big after post install such as re-installing GPU drivers etc. The more you change, the more you will revert tweaks & worsen your experience. I have a strict order to follow during setup. it is important that you read <a href="https://github.com/AesterFF/Eva-Continued/blob/main/content/docs/PRE-INSTALL.md">PRE-INSTALL</a> before you install EVA

### Requirements
## These are recommended requirments means if you dont even have those you still would be able to use this OS
  - SSD: You can install this OS on a Hard Drive but most of the tweaks and optimizations are based on SSD though you wont lose much performance if you use a Hard Disk
  - CPU: 2 cores & 4 threads or more
  - RAM: 8 gb or more
  - GPU: GT 710 or more
  - A moderate level of common sense
